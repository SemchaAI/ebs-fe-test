## Comments

1. In addition to the basket, it was also necessary to create another global space for products, since they are influenced by several components at once.

2. I was confused by the API provided for this task, I really didnâ€™t want the ability to manage query parameters, such as for filtering, sorting and pagination.

3. I still couldn't reduce the number of re-renders in this case, especially when pagination is completely performed on the fly by the frontend, probably I still don't have enough skills for it.

4. I am very glad that I was able to touch testing, I've never written anything like this before so I stopped on basic unit test of a button.
